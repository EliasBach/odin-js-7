# The Odin Project: Javascript Course Exercise 7
## Linked Lists

Description: This exercise asks to implemenet a Linked List, a common data structure in other programming languages, composed of data elements (nodes) and a link (pointer) to another data element.

This type of data structure is not really used in JavaScript since arrays are not limited to size and insertion and deletion can be done at any index.However, it can be used to illustrate the concept of a data structure.
